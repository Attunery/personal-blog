            <h2>Why I Decided to Learn Programming as a Clinician</h2>
            <div class="date">March 15, 2024</div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>After years of working in healthcare, I realized that technology was becoming increasingly important in our field. The decision to learn programming wasn't easy, but I knew it would open up new opportunities to improve patient care through technology.</p>
                <p>My background in healthcare has actually given me a unique perspective on problem-solving that I can now apply to coding challenges.</p>

            <h2>From Medical Records to Code: My First Month of Learning</h2>
            <div class="date">March 10, 2024</div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The first month of learning to code has been both challenging and exciting. I've discovered that the logical thinking required in medicine actually translates well to programming. However, the syntax and new concepts have been quite different from what I'm used to.</p>
                <p>I've been focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics, and I'm amazed at how quickly I can create something visible and interactive.</p>

            <h2>How My Medical Background Helps Me Debug Code</h2>
            <div class="date">March 5, 2024</div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Debugging code is surprisingly similar to diagnosing patients. Both require systematic thinking, attention to detail, and the ability to trace problems back to their source. I've found that my experience in differential diagnosis has been incredibly helpful when trying to figure out why my code isn't working.</p>
                <p>The methodical approach I learned in medical school has become my secret weapon in programming.</p>
